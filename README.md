# Memory-Game

One of my first projects with Springboard. It presents a classic memory game where the user can choose how many tiles they would like to have.
The tiles are a random selection of predefined colors which are shuffled using the [Fisher Yates Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).
I also added a function which algorithmically sets the board size and shape based on the closest factors of the number of tiles,
and reorients the board based on screen orientation.
I plan on revisiting this down the line to add functionality and update the CSS.
